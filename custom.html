				MOTHERBOARD
		</h3>

		<P class="box1">
			Choosing the best gaming motherboard or best motherboard for
another type of build is in many ways an integral part of your PC
build, despite the fact that choosing the best CPU or the best
graphics card often gets more attention. Nearly every part of your
PC plugs into your motherboard. Its form factor dictates the size of
your computer, and its chipset and socket limit what kind of
processor you can install.
If you’re not sure which chipset you’re after when choosing the
best gaming motherboard for you, or you have more basic
questions for a different type of build, you can visit our
motherboard basics and motherboard buying guide features to
help narrow down your buying options.
The picks below include the best gaming motherboards designed
for Intel's 10th Gen "Comet Lake," as well as 9th Generation
"Coffee Lake Refresh," followed by the lower-cost H370
alternative.
We'll of course add picks for the company's latest Rocket Lake-S-
compatible boards when we get them and start testing. For now,
you can check out our expansive Z590 motherboard feature , as
well as a few Z590 board previews. So far, we've gone in-depth
with the Gigabyte Z590 Vision G , ASRock Z590 Steel Legend 6E
Wi-Fi and Gigabyte's Z590 Aorus Master . Once we have a CPU to
test with (and any embargoes have lifted), we will add testing to
these boards and turn them into full reviews.
Below our mainstream picks, you’ll find our recommendations for
the best motherboards with Intel's high-end desktop (HEDT)
LGA-2066 socket and X299 chipset supporting the X-Series and
Extreme line of processors.
The second page of this guide covers the best AMD motherboards,
including X570 and B550 chipset models, as well as high-end
Threadripper picks that compete with Intel's X-Series platform.

			RAM MEMORY
		</h3>
		<img src="resources/trident3.jpg" alt="">
		
		
		<P class="box1">
			If you’re shopping for some memory for a new build, or an upgrade
to your existing laptop or desktop, and you’re confused whether
you need 8, 16, or 32GB (or more), how much clock speed matters,
or what memory timings actually mean, you’ve come to the right
place. We’ll help you work through the many things to consider
when shopping for RAM.
We’ll primarily be focusing on desktop memory here, although
much of the advice and technical details carry over to laptops as
well. With laptops, you’ll just have to buy an SO-DIMM (small
outline dual in-line memory modules) kit, rather than the longer
DIMMs (dual in-line memory modules) that are used in traditional
modern desktops. Many modern slim laptops also have their
memory soldered to the motherboard. So be sure to check your
manual before making any buying decisions

			SOLID STATE DRIVE
		</h3>
		<img src="resources/ssd3.jpg" alt="">
		
		
		<P class="box1">
			Getting one of the best SSDs for your system is key because the
easiest way to slow down a PC with one of the best CPUs is to pair
it with slow storage. Your processor can handle billions of cycles a
second, but it often spends a lot of time waiting for your drive to
feed it data. Hard drives are particularly sluggish because they
have platters that have to spin up and a read / right arm that has to
find its way physically to the data sectors you're currently seeking.
To get optimal performance, you need a good solid-state drive
(SSD) .
You can check out our feature for much more on the differences
between hard drives and SSDs . While SSDs are almost always
faster, there are still instances (like bulk storage) where hard
drives are definitely worth considering. Because 10TB hard drives
can be had for under $200 and a 4TB SSD will set you back over
$400.
If you already know about drive types and want specific
recommendations, check out our Best SSDs page. And if you're
after an external drive or SSD for portable storage or back up, be
sure to check our Best External Drives page . But if you don't have a
PhD in SSD, here are a few things you need to consider when
shopping.
As drives like Intel's 660p and its successor the Intel 665p start to
undercut mainstream drives on the old SATA interface while
delivering more speed, this could be the beginning of the end of
our old friend, Serial ATA. That said, Samsung recently released the
870 EVO , so SATA isn't dead yet. And existing SATA drives will
have to continue falling in price as well, in order to at least
compete on price, since they can't hope to keep up with NVMe
drives on performance.
But NVMe PCIe 3.0 drives, once the fastest storage around, have
been outclassed by PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSDs from the likes of Gigabyte ,
Corsair , Patriot and Samsung. These drives indeed up sequential
speeds dramatically (thanks to a doubling of the PCIe bus
bandwidth). But you'll need an AMD X570 or B550 motherboard to
run one of these drives at their top speed, or an Intel Z590
motherboard paired with one of Intel's upcoming Rocket Lake-S
processors. And in many ways, beyond the obvious bump in
sequential performance, users might not see much in the way of
real-world benefits from these drives . But there's no doubt that the
next generation of PCIe 4.0 drives, like WD Black's SN850 , are
impressively agile.

			You can't lose with AMD or Intel: Both companies offer good
budget chips, and overall CPU performance between comparative
parts is closer than it’s been in years. You can see how the chips
stack up in our CPU Benchmarks Hierarchy. That said, if you’re
primarily interested in gaming, Intel’s chips will generally deliver
slightly better performance (and consume more power) when
paired with a graphics card , while AMD’s Raven Ridge models (like
the AMD Ryzen 3 2200G ) do a better job of delivering gaming-
capable performance at modest settings and resolutions without
the need for a graphics card.
Clock speed is more important than core count: Higher clock
speeds translate to snappier performance in simple, common
tasks such as gaming, while extra cores will help you get through
time-consuming workloads faster.
Budget for a full system: Don't pair a strong CPU with weak
storage, RAM and/or graphics .
Overclocking isn’t for everyone, but the ability to squeeze more
performance out of a budget offering is enticing. Intel doesn't have
overclocking-capable processors for the sub-$125 market, but
AMD's processors allow for tuning, and in most cases the bundled
AMD cooler is sufficient for the task. Automated overclocking
features in most motherboards make the process easy, so even the
least tech-savvy users can enjoy the benefits.
For even more information, check out our CPU Buyer’s Guide ,
where we discuss how much you should spend for what you’re
looking to do, and when cores matter more than high clock speeds.
If you can expand your budget and buy a mainstream or high-end
processor, check out our lists of Best CPUs for Gaming and Best
CPUs for Workstations . Below, you'll see our favorite budget picks.
